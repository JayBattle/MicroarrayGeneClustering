# MicroarrayGeneClustering
Shell scripts and C programs for DNA microarray calibration and analysis with gene clustering.

This class inspired project creates a automated command line interface to calibrate, analysize, 
and cluster genes from DNA microarray data files. This project consists of C programs, Shell
scripts, and a Makefile. A sample data set from the paper Chu et. Al is included for testing.
The output of the project is a series of text files containing the expressed, stationary, and 
supressed genes for each data set.
